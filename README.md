# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is part of the Odin Project course in the advanced Javascript section, where im going to demonstrate what i have learned on the lesson "Factory Functions and the Module Pattern".
It also represents the debut in my learning process where i start to give importance to the organisation of my code and to its readability in the long run, thanks to the use of factory functions.
